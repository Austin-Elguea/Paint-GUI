# Some ideas for my Paint application:

- Background color changer i.e such as a drop down box with 10 or so colors to choose from *FINISHED*

- More shapes to draw

- Textbox ? Adding text to the paint surface

- Saving creations as a JPEG file ?

- Inserting images from computer files

- Allow users to change font of text

- General color picker.. Instead of the color array add color buttons down the side or something.

# Down the road.
- EVENTUALLY, a mobile app ??
